# Jellyfin Media Downloader

A simple Python script to download all media files from a Jellyfin server.

Not a direct fork, but many parts were taken from https://github.com/DrewThomasson/ipod-JellyFin-Downloader

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- `requests` library
- `tqdm` library for progress bars

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

Edit the configuration section at the top of `getJellyfin.py`:

```python
# --- CONFIGURATION ---
JELLYFIN_URL = "https://your-jellyfin-server.com"
USER_NAME = "your_username"
JELLYFIN_PASSWORD = "your_password"
DOWNLOAD_PATH = '/path/to/download/folder'
DRY_RUN = False  # Set to True to test without downloading
```

### Configuration Options

- `JELLYFIN_URL`: Full URL to your Jellyfin server
- `USER_NAME`: Your Jellyfin username
- `JELLYFIN_PASSWORD`: Your Jellyfin password
- `DOWNLOAD_PATH`: Local directory where files will be saved
- `DRY_RUN`: Set to `True` to see what would be downloaded without actually downloading

## Usage

1. Configure the script with your Jellyfin server details
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 getJellyfin.py
   ```

The script will:
1. Authenticate with your Jellyfin server
2. Fetch all video media items
3. Download each file to your specified directory
4. Show progress for each download
5. Skip files that already exist

## Security Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This script stores your Jellyfin password in plain text. Make sure to:
- Keep the script file secure and private
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive information
- Only run this script on trusted systems
